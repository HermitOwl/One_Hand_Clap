Levels are two-dimensional side-scrolling areas with natural looking platforms, i.e. If a person could jump on it in a single bound in real life, they can bounce on it in game. The level progression can be grouped into "Stages" based on the narrative construct. 
Every level is based on a sense of skewed reality. This can be better explained as: every in game object has a sense of realism to it(outside of the main overriding aesthetic of the art style) but is a little off to show case the slight deviation from norm that the protagonist is going through. 
Each level is a progressive and shares a sense of diagesis with the narative to ensure player immersion to both storyline and game play. this could better be explained by going through each level individually
