- loses car to theft in a supposedly secure parking area
- Get's lumped into an uncomfortable situation at a university where protag get's mildly assaulted
- harrassed by the police unfairly
- goes home to find their partner has been unfaithful 
the protag then snaps and the game begins when he/she slaps their partner.
